CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSES PROVIDE A STANDARD SET OF TERMS AND
CONDITIONS THAT CREATORS AND OTHER RIGHTS HOLDERS MAY USE TO SHARE
ORIGINAL WORKS OF AUTHORSHIP AND OTHER MATERIAL SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT
AND CERTAIN OTHER RIGHTS SPECIFIED IN THE PUBLIC LICENSE BELOW. THE
FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, ARE NOT
EXHAUSTIVE, AND DO NOT FORM PART OF OUR LICENSES.

     CONSIDERATIONS FOR LICENSORS: OUR PUBLIC LICENSES ARE
     INTENDED FOR USE BY THOSE AUTHORIZED TO GIVE THE PUBLIC
     PERMISSION TO USE MATERIAL IN WAYS OTHERWISE RESTRICTED BY
     COPYRIGHT AND CERTAIN OTHER RIGHTS. OUR LICENSES ARE
     IRREVOCABLE. LICENSORS SHOULD READ AND UNDERSTAND THE TERMS
     AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE THEY CHOOSE BEFORE APPLYING IT.
     LICENSORS SHOULD ALSO SECURE ALL RIGHTS NECESSARY BEFORE
     APPLYING OUR LICENSES SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN REUSE THE
     MATERIAL AS EXPECTED. LICENSORS SHOULD CLEARLY MARK ANY
     MATERIAL NOT SUBJECT TO THE LICENSE. THIS INCLUDES OTHER CC-

     THE LICENSOR'S PERMISSION IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ANY REASON--FOR
     EXAMPLE, BECAUSE OF ANY APPLICABLE EXCEPTION OR LIMITATION TO
     COPYRIGHT--THEN THAT USE IS NOT REGULATED BY THE LICENSE. OUR
     LICENSES GRANT ONLY PERMISSIONS UNDER COPYRIGHT AND CERTAIN
     OTHER RIGHTS THAT A LICENSOR HAS AUTHORITY TO GRANT. USE OF
     THE LICENSED MATERIAL MAY STILL BE RESTRICTED FOR OTHER
     REASONS, INCLUDING BECAUSE OTHERS HAVE COPYRIGHT OR OTHER
     RIGHTS IN THE MATERIAL. A LICENSOR MAY MAKE SPECIAL REQUESTS,
     SUCH AS ASKING THAT ALL CHANGES BE MARKED OR DESCRIBED.
     ALTHOUGH NOT REQUIRED BY OUR LICENSES, YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO
     RESPECT THOSE REQUESTS WHERE REASONABLE. MORE CONSIDERATIONS
