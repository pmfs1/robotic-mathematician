>— *It's advised that you split the data into two subsets, with 80% of the images to the training set and 20% of the images to the testing set; the separation of images ensures that given what an adequately trained model has learned previously, it can accurately classify relevant images not previously examined. The variety in the dataset gives robustness to an appropriately trained model, which is evident through the accuracy on the testing data (up to 95.12%) when fed through such model. For those who use a train-test-validate structure we recommend, in that case, that you split the data into three subsets, with 75% of the images to the training set, 10% of the images to the testing set and 15% of the images to the validation set.*
